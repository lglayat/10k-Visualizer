Noteslocker is a web application that functions as an online marketplace for students to buy notes and sell ones they have written.

This version only supports .txt files.

Once the backend is running, (refer to 'https://github.com/lglayat/Noteslocker/blob/master/Visualizer_Backend/README.md')

run npm start in your terminal to get start the front end.

The front end of this project is written in ReactJs and uses Redux to store session information for the application.

Users can either sign up or log in with their existing account.

From there users can either view existing notes by searching a term in the search bar or go to categories to view notes by area of study.

The other main feature exists on the 'profile page', where uses can drag and drop .txt files and upload their notes. Once uploaded, the newly created note will appear on their page.
